            <p>
                Between September 2021 and Feburary 2022, I worked as a Store Assistant for Roebridge Farm Shop in Southampton. I unfortunatley had to relenquish my position at the company to focus my efforts on my A levels, along with learning to drive. While working at the shop, I learned several important skills, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Gaining customer service skills by running the tills during busy hours, directing customers around the shop, and answering customer questions about the origin, freshness and uses of the produce for sale.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Improving teamworking and communication skills by working with my other colleague on shift to deliver efficient service.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Improving communication and teaching skills when training new members of staff to use equipment, both in customer service, such as the tills, and in packaging of produce, such as the netting and bagging equipment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Carrying out minor maintenance work on shop equipment.
                </li>
            </ul>
